      <h1>2. PAGANINI: THE DEVIL'S VIOLINIST</h1>
      <h2>[2022] – 4 Weeks</h2>

        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>I was tasked to create a modular structured poster for the SAIC Spring 2022 Architecture Lecture Series.</p>
        
        <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>Explore a set of three logos for a historical figure: one reflecting their personality, another their heritage, and last, their business or occupation. A final logo is chosen to develop coherent and compelling visual applications</p>

        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>The final design was inspired by the music notation of Flying Staccatos. It is one of the notable violin-bowing techniques popularized by Paganini. He threw his bow in whipping action and playing scale passages with incredible rapidity. The irregular font style and position convey the spontaneity of his music compositions but maintain sophisticated.</p>

        <h2>DELIVERABLES</h2>
        <p>Cover Letter (11”x8.5”) /
          Envelope / 
          Business Card /
          Sticker Seal /
          Brand Guide</p>

        <h2>BEHIND THE SCENE</h2>
        <p>I created a harmonic architectural space constructed with dynamic types and shapes. This design invites the audience into an energetic space and showcases each architect's iconic design. A gradient palette was chosen to enhance the sense of spacial depth.</p>
